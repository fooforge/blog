It's on! You can now buy the first bunch of tickets for our **Git Ninja Class** workshop!

**Here are the facts**:

- Git is a free and open source distributed version control system. It's invention was a blessing to the whole software world. However, it takes a bit of training to become really productive. Now is the best time to level up to become a real git Ninja!

- Attending this workshop, **you get a six month micro plan for github.com**

- You get the chance to meet our special guest **Mike Adolphs** from GitHub

It's also important to note that the first eight tickets will be sold with an **early bird** price, make sure to grab one while they are hot!
